&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;International Energy Agency (IEA)&lt;/strong&gt; released the Global Energy Review in 2020. The report stated that &lt;strong&gt;15% of the daily electricity demand&lt;/strong&gt; has been reduced. It highlighted the carbon dioxide emissions and the global energy demand in the year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report stated that decline in the electricity demand is due to lockdown imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries such as India, Italy, France, UK.  The report was based on the survey collected from &lt;strong&gt;30 countries&lt;/strong&gt; including India and China. The pandemic has reduced fossil-fuel based power generation. In India, the production of electricity has declined by &lt;strong&gt;32.2% as compared&lt;/strong&gt; to the 2019 level.&lt;/p&gt;
