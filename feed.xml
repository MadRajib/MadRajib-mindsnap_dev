&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;International Energy Agency (IEA)&lt;/strong&gt; released the Global Energy Review in 2020. The report stated that &lt;strong&gt;15% of the daily electricity demand&lt;/strong&gt; has been reduced. It highlighted the carbon dioxide emissions and the global energy demand in the year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report stated that decline in the electricity demand is due to lockdown imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries such as India, Italy, France, UK.  The report was based on the survey collected from &lt;strong&gt;30 countries&lt;/strong&gt; including India and China. The pandemic has reduced fossil-fuel based power generation. In India, the production of electricity has declined by &lt;strong&gt;32.2% as compared&lt;/strong&gt; to the 2019 level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raksha Mantri Shri Rajnath Singh has approved the proposal of Engineer-in-Chief of Military Engineering Services (MES) for optimisation of more than 9,300 posts in the basic and industrial workforce. It is in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts, headed by Lt General Shekatkar, which had recommended measures to enhance combat capability and rebalance defence expenditure of the Armed Forces.
The Committee was to restructure the civilian workforce in a manner that the work of MES could be partly done by departmentally employed staff and other works could be outsourced. In line with the recommendations made by the Committee, based on the proposal of E-in-C, MES, the proposal of abolition of 9,304 posts in MES out of the total 13,157 vacancies of the Basic and Industrial staff has been approved by Raksha Mantri.
The recommendation was aimed at making MES an effective organisation with a leaner workforce, well equipped to handle complex issues in the emerging scenario in an efficient and cost effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Styrene gas leaked from LG Polymers Plant in Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The plant was located about 15 km from the coastal city of Vizag. The changes in temperature inside a storage tank resulted in a leak.
Around 5 villages were affected due to the leak. The gas has spread across a radius of 3 km affecting at least 5 villages and over 3000 people. According to the sources, a gas leak occurred on 7th May – Thursday at 2 AM on in the morning and quickly spread to around 5 villages in the vicinity of RR Venkatapuram where the plant is located.
What is Styrene Gas?
• Styrene is a chemical compound that has been identified as neuro-toxins.
• It is also known as ethenylbenzene, vinylbenzene, and phenylephrine.
• The chemical formula of Styrene Gas is C6H5CH=CH2.
• Styrene gas is a by-product of highly flammable raw material Styrene.
• The gas produced by burning styrene is poisonous in nature. Coming to chemical properties, Styrene Gas is a colour-less and odour-less compound.
Health Impacts of Styrene Gas:
• Styrene gas affects the respiratory system.
• It causes chest congestion, gasping, air hunger and wheezing.
• It slowly paralyses the lung muscles causing complete respiratory paralysis. This leads to death due to oxygen deprivation.
• Death occurs within 10 minutes of continuous exposure to concentrate Styrene gas.

&lt;p&gt;FAME-II could reduce transport energy needs by 64%, emissions by 37% by 2030: CII. The government’s FAME-II plan for electric mobility stands to reduce 64% of the anticipated road-based energy demand by 2030 and 37% of carbon emissions by then, according to CII. The government had earlier this year notified the second phase of its scheme for the Faster Adoption and Manufacture of (hybrid and) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) which sought to boost the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in the country. The tentative aim is to have 30% electric vehicles by 2030.
• India can save 64% of anticipated road-based mobility-related energy demand and 37% of carbon emissions in 2030 by pursuing a shared, electric, and connected mobility future, based on the findings of the study by Government of India,” CII said in a statement.
• This would result in reduction of 156 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) in diesel and petrol consumption for that year and net saving of approximately $60 billion in 2030 at present oil prices,” the industry body added. “This is also in line with the India’s vision of reducing oil imports by 10% by 2022.
• The FAME Scheme seeks to encourage the faster adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles by offering upfront incentives on the purchase of electric vehicles and by establishing the infrastructure required for the charging of these vehicles.
• Transport continues to be the highest oil consuming sector and the use of diesel and petrol grew at 5.9% and 9.9% respectively in the last 10 years,” CII said. “As per government’s estimates, the country’s import dependency on oil has increased from 78.3 per cent of total consumption in 2014-15 to settling at a new high of 83.7% in the 10-month period of FY19.
• The government has allocated Rs.10,000cr for FAME-II which is Rs.895 cr higher than allocated for FAME-I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1948, diplomatic relations were established between the Soviet Union and North Korea. The Soviet military forces supported the Korean People’s Army during the Korean War. N. Korea was established as communist bloc gaining maximum support from Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Kim Jong Una commemorative war medal to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany. The medal was awarded to recognize the North Korean leader’s role in preserving the memory of Soviet soldiers who died on North Korean territory.
In 2019, Russia invited Kim Jong Un to visit Moscow on 9 May and attend the military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory. Russian President later announced the decision to postpone the parade indefinitely in April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2015, the North Korean leader rejected an invitation by Moscow to attend the 70th anniversary, citing domestic affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
