In 1948, diplomatic relations were established between the Soviet Union and North Korea. The Soviet military forces supported the Korean People's Army during the Korean War. N. Korea was established as communist bloc gaining maximum support from Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Kim Jong Una commemorative war medal to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany. The medal was awarded to recognize the North Korean leader's role in preserving the memory of Soviet soldiers who died on North Korean territory.
In 2019, Russia invited Kim Jong Un to visit Moscow on 9 May and attend the military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the victory. Russian President later announced the decision to postpone the parade indefinitely in April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2015, the North Korean leader rejected an invitation by Moscow to attend the 70th anniversary, citing domestic affairs.
