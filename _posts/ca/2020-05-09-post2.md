Defence Minister Rajnath Singh dedicated to the nation a new 80-km road in Uttarakhand which connects close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and opens a new route for Kailash Mansarovar yatra via Lipulekh Pass, significantly reducing the travel time for yatris.



Road for Kailash- Mansarovar Yatra:

• The Border Roads Organization (BRO) has constructed the road that originates from Ghatiabagarh and it ends at Lipulekh Pass which is a gateway to Kailash-Mansarovar.
• It will help pilgrims visiting Kailash Mansarovar in Tibet as it is around 90 kms from the Lipulekh pass. This road, which has an altitude ranging from 6000 to 17060 feet, constructed along the banks of river Kali between India and Nepal.

With this connectivity, passengers will now take 6 days less to travel than before, a light vehicle can ply up to 75 kms (5 km short of boundary) and a five day trek will be reduced to two days. The event was attended by Director General of BRO Lt Gen Harpal Singh,Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Chief of Army Staff General M M Naravane, Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar, Lok Sabha Member of Parliament from Almora (Uttarakhand) Shri Ajay Tamta and senior officials of Ministry of Defence and BRO.
